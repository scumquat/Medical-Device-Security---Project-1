# Medical-Device-Security---Project-1
This is a project that uses an Arduino Leonardo, a basic LED circuit and a USB-TTL cable to 1) monitor sensor data on the arduino using the serial monitor, and use the cable to observe a second serial monitor 2) use the TTL cable to flash code onto the Arduino by the second serial bus and 3) use a state machine to control the Arduino
