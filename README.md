# Medical-Device-Security---Project-1
This is a project that uses an Arduino Leonardo, a basic LED circuit and a USB-TTL cable to 1) monitor sensor data on the arduino using the serial monitor, and use the cable to observe a second serial monitor 2) use the TTL cable to flash code onto the Arduino by the second serial bus and 3) use a state machine to control the Arduino


## Definitions
### Serial Communication
*   What is Serial Communication
*   How do devices communicate serially?
*   What is a Serial Communciation Protocol
*   What is a Serial Monitor
### Baud Rate
*   What is Baud Rate
*   How do you calculate baud
### TTL Cable
*   [This is our cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954)
*   This allows a device to use a USB cable to send data over pins
*   V_cc: +3.3V, GND: ground, Tx: Data out, Rx: Data in
### Arduino Leonardo
*   [Documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo/)

## State Machine
*   What is a statemachine
*   Rules
*   Block Diagram
*   Circuit Diagram
* *  linkercad simulation would be nice
